# Technical Report: Multilingual Text Classification System
### Automated Language Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Executive Summary
Language classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational linguistics, requiring sophisticated pattern recognition and statistical analysis. This report details a system that leverages modern machine learning techniques to differentiate between English and non-English texts with high accuracy.
